        <p> Hey, my name is Piper! I like cheese and bananas, but not together. I also think that pink towels should be a thing because we should be able to live a Barbie lifestyle. Also, really random, but we absolutely need a mojo dojo casa house at Berkeley so that we can be the epicenter of all things Barbenheimer and not an earthquake. I really don't know what to say lol. I'm really excited to be in the WDD Decal and am so excited to get to know everyone better! </p>

            <li>One thing I learned: Honestly, I learned about how much I overlooked certain features. For example, I never realized that Spotify keeping the playing song in view was an intentional decision, and probably to increase user engagement.</li>
            <li>My favorite part was when the article actually broke down the Spotify 'case study' and touched on each individual feature</li>
            <li>My favorite quote: "through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way</li>
            <li>8/10 </li>
