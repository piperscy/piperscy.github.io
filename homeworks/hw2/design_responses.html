					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the importance of white space in product design and how it can greatly affect user experience in a lot of different aspects. I never realized how white spraced actually contributed to improving focus, visual organization, and readability. It was also interesting to learn how Wayfair implemented the rule of 8 to achieve consistency in their use of white space, and thought that was pretty cool formula. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I always thought that you had to maximize the space you were given, so I found it interesting that white space was the opposite of what I had learned before, sort of a 'less is more' perspective. I really liked the Wayfair example too because I got to see how this applied to real life situations/seeing real life applications of this topic was nice.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "White space is not wasted space"</p>
						</li>
