							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Okay this article was paywalled, but from the snippet they did give us, I learned that we make lots of unrelated associations simply from the way our brain worked. I really like the example of looking up at the sky and noticing an unusually shaped cloud. Right then, we immediately think that it resembles a familiar animal or object - our brain immediately, and subconsciously makes that association. It's, I guess, our brain's way of making sense of the world and starting that assimilation and adaptation process of filling in the gaps to view the bigger picture.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked the part where they discussed the theory of Gestalt, the visual perception principle used in the 1920. I found the idea that the organized whole is better than the sum of its parts" really interesting, and found many applications of the theory to everyday life. it just showed how visual design + psychology have a greater impact on how we live our lives than we think </p>
