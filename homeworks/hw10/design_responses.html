							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I agree with the article in the sense that psychology influences how we view certain things (basically gaming attention). Although I do disagree a little with it. The article describes certain types of attention and how we should use certain things to make people pay more attention, but I also know that sometimes human minds are very random and unpredictable and doing the perfect formula to maximize attention may not necessarily guarantee that more attention will be spent (that the design will be effective),it only improves the chances of this happening. </p>

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> 7, we often only think of ourselves (what looks pretty) when designing, but very rarely do we realize that there is actually science behind why designers do the things that they do</p>
