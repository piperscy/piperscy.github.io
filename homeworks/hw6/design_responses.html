					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>how animations can be utilized in a very effective manner. the specific situations which would warrant the use of animations, and how to best use them/which context is most appropriate.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really liked the graphic of the dogs with the walking animation set to different speeds. I really liked how they broke down which speeds were optimal for different devices and why. I never considered that having a bigger device meant that it takes longer for objects to "overcome the path" and therefore needed a longer duration </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "These figures are based on the particular qualities of the human brain" - again, just showing how animations are maximized in modern media to elicit a certain reaction from viewers/readers</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
