                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned the different types of animations that can be performed, like movements, expansions etc. I also learned how they can be implemented in different pages to serve different purposes. I used to think that these types of animations were impossible to code (very much overlooked them) but now I'm realizing that it's entirely possible </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> The wide variety of transitions and animations that you could see. Definitely many things I used to overlook and now realize is actually an intentional feature that is fairly difficult to implement. Really loved the different ways you could apply these features and how they could serve different purposes to affect the user's experience. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked the Selected Works Transitions Experiments the most. I thought the transition was very unique, and was implemented in a way that I hadn't seen before (unlike the map and the credit card page, this used it for a whole new purpose).</p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 9, I found the animations really cool and something I hadn't previously thought of before. </p>
